# cxl-reskit/tools

Once you have run the top level bootstrap script, this subdirectory will contain essential CXL-related tools.

## ndctl

The ndctl package originally contained only tools for administering NVDIMMs and other non-volatile memory.
Those tools are now becoming generalized for non-volatile CXL memory.

But the ndctl repo also contains tools for administering volatile CXL memory, including daxctl and cxl_cli.

## Usage Examples


* Convert special purpose memory to "online" memory
* Attempt to convert "online" memory to special purpose
* come up with some cxl_cli examples
